# SpringBoot Basics

## What is springboot
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run"

## Features
- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

## What does it mean when we say springBoot is opinionated?
- It means that SpringBoot projects have best practices about how a spring app should be build and if we use those best practices then it tries to do the required bindings automatically

## What all things will we be using the most?
-
